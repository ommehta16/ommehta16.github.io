                    A platform for hosting competitive programming contests, practice contests, and just practicing.
                    I've written a handful of problems and almost completely re-written the code that powers it.

                <h3>WIDE</h3>
                <p>
                    I built most of the W Image Data Editor (WIDE), my group's final project for the Tufts Coding
                    Academy.<br><br>
                    WIDE is a lightweight pygame-based image editor that implements a <i>lot</i> of effects: you can
                    sepiate, sharpen, brighten, invert, blur, increase contrast on, rotate the hue of, or apply a
                    painterly effect to the image. It comes with some basic add and multiply operations as well.

                        I started in CPT at the start of the '23-'24 school year, and have done a <i>lot</i> in it
                        since! Since joining, I've helped my team win WWPIT, get a silver medal in CALICO Sp'24, and win
                        Lockheed Martin Codequest in Moorestown. I'm currently a leader, and am working on rewriting the

                        I led my group of 3 to make an WIDE, a python-based image-editor app as a part of the Tufts
                        pre-college program. We ended up following through with the name, and won best project during
